# organiser
Will be used to help me keep track of the project I am working on.
</br>
Currently there are more files which are required (dll's and so) to properly install the organiser. The files being uploaded here is just the stuff which I have worked on.

Note: This does have a client side in HTML/JS/CSS and a server side in C#.
